<strong> Baby Assurance </strong>
 <br>
Baby Assurance is a web application designed to help parents add and review baby products for safety.

<strong> Motivation </strong>
 <br>
As a full time teacher, mom, wife and part-time software engineer student I have my hands full. My 18 month old toddler is the size of a three year old. Literally! So while I try to divide my attention between him and the many other task on my plate, he constanly finds things to get into. Hence, every other day I log into Amazon.com to find the newest tool, gadget, or baby product that will help baby proof the house and reassure me that my little guy is safe while I work. Unfortunately alot of the reviews are more focused on how well a child likes the product or how pretty it is rather than how safe it is. This brought me to the idea behind my Rails project. Why not create a web application that specifically allows people to add and review the baby products that they own with a focus on what parents really care about safety.
